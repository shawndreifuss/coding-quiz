# coding-quiz



## Description
 
 To create a a short quiz using javascript with a leaderboard of highscores that pulls from local store, a timer that counts down as you start the game and a score at the end! during this homework i learned so much and furthered my knowledge on JS, by using functions for loops and addevent listeners i was able to creat my mini coding quiz! 



## Usage

the user will be prompted to start the mini quiz once start game is clicked the timer will count down from 30 seconds if a question is incorrect the timer goes down by 5 and the score goes down 5 as well. if correct the score will go up by 10! at the end you will put your initials onto the leaderboard and it will store it for future games and will list the score by whoever has the highest
